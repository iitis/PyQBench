# User guide

PyQBench can be used in two different ways:

- As a library. This is a more extensible, but also more laborious way of using PyQBench.
  Most importantly, this way allows for more advanced scripting defining your own measurements
  scheme.
- As a CLI tool. This mode of operation trades extensibility for simplicity of usage, as it
  allows only for running Fourier-discrimination experiments defined with simple YAML input files.

Refer to the guides below for in-depth walkthroughs.
