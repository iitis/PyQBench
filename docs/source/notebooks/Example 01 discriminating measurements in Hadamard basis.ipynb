    "# Usage as a library\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide introduces basic concepts needed for using PyQBench as a library from a Python\n",
    "script. In particular, we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining experiment using circuit components.\n",
    "- Assembling circuits needed for given benchmarking scheme.\n",
    "- Running experiment on simulator or hardware.\n",
    "- Obtaining empirical probability of successful discrimination between measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting the stage\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, make sure you installed PyQBench (see installation for \n",
    "detailed instructions).\n",
    "Optionally, you might want to install matplotlib library for plotting the final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we won't repeat mathematical foundations needed for understanding measurement\n",
    "discrimination experiments. We'll only restrict ourselves to the details necessary for running \n",
    "experiments using PyQBench. However, we encourage you to check out {ref}`section/math` to\n",
    "get a better grasp of the entities and concepts discussed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we need?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the conceptual level, every discrimination experiment performed in PyQBench needs the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discriminator, i.e. optimal initial state for the circuit.\n",
    "- Unitary $U^\\dagger$ defining alternative measurement to be discriminated from the measurement\n",
    "  in Z-basis.\n",
    "- $V_0^\\dagger$ and $V_1^\\dagger$, positive and negative parts of optimal \n",
    "  measurement from Holevo-Helstrom theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently available quantum computers typically cannot start execution from an arbitrary state. \n",
    "Instead, we have to prepare it ourselves. Hence, to execute experiment using postselection \n",
    "scheme, we need the following operations implemented as Qiskit Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An instruction taking $|00\\rangle$ to the desired discriminator.\n",
    "- Instructions implementing $U^\\dagger$, $V_0^\\dagger$ and $V_1^\\dagger$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task of implementing needed instruction is trivial when we know the decomposition of our \n",
    "unitaries into sequences of gates. If we only know the unitary matrices, we can either decompose \n",
    "them by hand, or try using one of the available transpilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the direct-sum experiment we don't use $V_0^\\dagger$ and $V_1^\\dagger$ separately. Instead, \n",
    "we need a two-qubit gate $V_0^\\dagger \\oplus V_1^\\dagger$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our toy model\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we will use $U = H$ (the Hadamard gate). To keep us focused on the implementation\n",
    "in PyQBench and not delve too deep into mathematical explanation, we simply provide explicit \n",
    "formulas for discriminator $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$ and $V_0$ and $V_1$, leaving the \n",
    "calculations to the interested reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explicit formula for discriminator in our toy model reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "| \\Psi_0 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (| 00 \\rangle + | 11 \\rangle),\n",
    "$$ \n",
