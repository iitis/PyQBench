# Usage as a CLI tool

Using PyQBench as a library allows one to conduct, in principle, arbitrary two-qubit von Neumann 
measurement experiment. However, as discussed in the previous guide, it requires some amount of 
boilerplate code.

However, for a Fourier parametrized family of measurements, PyQBench offers a simplified way of 
performing the experiment using a Command Line Interface (CLI).
